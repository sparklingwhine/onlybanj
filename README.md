My project is OnlyBanj - a parody fansite website spoofing the popular "OnlyFans" website... except its focus is on my 10 year old cat, Banjo. It features a welcome section, a Banjo Facts section, a biography, a pictures section, and a contact form. 

The features I have implemented include:

CSS:

-A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item --- a hamburger menu is present at smaller resolutions, but when enlarged it changes to a vertical menu and then a horizontal menu, all via media queries. 

-Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop --- I used Flexbox so that at larger resolutions the layout changes from single column to two columns. 

-Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table --- on my vertical menu (on medium sized resolutions) I used this to style my first row differently, which is a link to the Home section.

JAVASCRIPT:

-Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section) --- I have js validation on my Contact form, which validates email and returns an alert to the user, indicating if they have incorrect or correct formatting. 

-Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction --- this show/hide js functionality is part of my hamburger menu. 


No special instructions are needed to run this project.
